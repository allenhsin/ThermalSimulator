ThermalSimulator
================

A MIT ISG Project



I. Boost Libraries Installation:
    The simulator requires the Boost C++ libraries.
    Here's a quick installation tutorial (revised from the boost website)
    1. Download Boost C++ libraries from http://www.boost.org/
    2. Extract files from the tar ball, e.g. tar --bzip2 -xf /path/to/boost_1_53_0.tar.bz2
    3. Go into the extracted boost folder, e.g. cd /path/to/boost_1_53_0
    4. Run the configuration script by 
            ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=path/to/thermal_simulator/root --with-libraries=filesystem,system
    5. Run installation by
            ./b2 install
    6. Done!
    7. Extra step for cygwin users. For some reason, cygwin expects the files to be compiled to dll
        files named cygboost_*.dll.a as opposed to libboost_*.dll.a. Change the file names to cygboost
        and or else you will getting missing dll errors when running the program.
