# This file defines the layer properties of the chip
# The format is
#
#   LAYER_THICKNESS  LAYER_THERMAL_CONDUCTIVITY  LAYER_SPECIFIC_HEAT
#
# units:    thickness - [m] 
#           thermal conductivity - [W/(m-K)]
#           specific heat - [J/(m^3-K)]
#
# some common numbers at around 300K:
#                       thermal conductivity    specific heat
#   silicon:            149.0                   1.65e6
#   silicon dioxide:    1.38                    2.27e6

# Note: The first layer has to be the device layer, and the following
#       layers should be in order.

# device layer (transistors and optical devices) - comb. of silicon and silicon dioxide
100e-9 5.00 2.00e6

# SOI buried oxide layer (BOX) - silicon dioxide
150e-9 1.38 2.27e6

# substrate layer - silicon
300e-6 149.0 1.65e6
