ThermalSimulator
===============================================================================

A MIT ISG Project

I. Boost Libraries Installation:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The simulator requires the Boost C++ libraries.
    Here's a quick installation tutorial (revised from the boost website)
    1.  Download Boost C++ libraries from http://www.boost.org/
    2.  Extract files from the tar ball, 
            e.g. tar --bzip2 -xf /path/to/boost_1_53_0.tar.bz2
    3.  Go into the extracted boost folder, e.g. 
            cd /path/to/boost_1_53_0
    4.  Run the configuration script by 
            ./bootstrap.sh  --prefix=path/to/thermal_simulator/root 
                            --with-libraries=filesystem,system
    5.  Run installation by
            ./b2 install
    6.  Done!
    7.  Extra step for cygwin users. For some reason, cygwin expects the files 
        to be compiled to dll files named cygboost_*.dll.a as opposed to 
        libboost_*.dll.a. Change the file names to cygboost and or else you will
        getting missing dll errors when running the program.

II, Simulator Configuration:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The simulator can be tuned by the configuration files in the configs/ 
    folder. For different parts of the simulator, for instance the thermal 
    model and physical model, several different configuration files and 
    input files are required and are discussed as follows:

    1. configs/thermal_sim.cfg
        This is the top level simulator config file. it defines the 
        sub-config files to different parts of the simulator as well
        as log system control.

    2. configs/thermal_model
        This folder contains the config file and input files for the
        thermal model. The .flp file is the floorplan file which defines
        the physical arrangement of the chip functional blocks and devices.
        The .init file, when used, defines the initial temperature of the
        floorplan blocks when running simulation.

    3. configs/physical_model
        This folder contains the config file and input files for the
        physical model.
