I. How to write the Optical Link Netlist
    The optical link netlist is used to build the physical model of the link.
    The format of the netlist is similar to a spice or spectre one. It defines
    the connectivity of the components like ring resonators, waveguide, laser
    source and transceivers. Device-specific design parameters such as ring
    radius or laser power can also be defined here. 
    
    The syntax of the netlist is
        
        TYPE NAME [PORT LIST]
